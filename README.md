### Planet Generator

[screenshot of site when it's up]

This is a small javascript library designed to output random (imaginary) planets. The names are generated following some arbitrary rules I made up. Composition, densities, locations, etc are calculated realistically based on some randomly-chosen initial constraints. Populations are similarly randomly chosen.

This library can be seen in use here: [Link coming later]
